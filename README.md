# InstaCal 
Can't find information about what you're eating. Well, let the InstaCal application do it for you. This application processes the image you upload to provide data on what you eat. It tells you the calories, and a breif description about what the food is. Enhance your life by using this application in your everyday life!

## Inspiration
We were inspired to build this app because we were interested in machine learning and bringing a more cohesive user experience into our current web development design skills, and believed that this would be an excellent opportunity to develop and try out some of those skills!

## What it does
The InstaCal team has developed a convenient and user-friendly web application to find information about what you're eating. This application processes the image you upload to provide data on what you eat. It tells you the calories, carbs, fat and protein associated with your meal along with a brief description. Enhance your life by using this application in your everyday life!

## How we built it
The front end is built by React.js and Flask. The backend utilized python in a google colab to fine-tune a yolov5 model, which was exported to VSCode.

## Challenges we ran into
Front-end: element alignment issues, issues with cross-platforms Back-end: figuring out dependencies and how everything integrated together

## What's next for InstaCal
In the future we can see ourselves implementing a user profile and calendar integration to include multiple meals across multiple days. Weâ€™d also like to implement machine learning to help people manage and analyse their foods as having an overall health effect over time.
